I'm an IT professional working at a higher education help desk who dabbles in a little bit of everything! Homelabbing, programming,
hacking, you name it!

This blog will be for my write-ups, experiments, experiences, and whatever else tech-y that might fit. I don't plan to update this 
regularly, but when I do I'm going to try to make it good!
